# Judge Agent

## Project Intent

A judge agent that evaluates both text and video content and produces four types of analysis:

1. **Origin prediction** — whether the content was generated by a human, AI, or a collaboration of both
2. **Virality score** — likelihood the content would perform well socially, based on content-intrinsic signals
3. **Distribution analysis** — which audiences or communities the content would most likely resonate with and why
4. **Explanation** — a concise rationale for each output the agent produces

## Assumptions

**1. Origin: Human, AI, or AI-Assisted Spectrum**

- Origin is modeled as a three-way prediction: `human`, `ai`, or `ai-assisted`. The `ai-assisted` label captures content that was drafted, structured, cleaned up, or templated with AI involvement but carries meaningful human contribution.

- Primary detection uses GPTZero API (via `GPTZERO_API_KEY` from `.env`) for text content classification. GPTZero is called via a direct HTTP POST to https://api.gptzero.me/v2/predict/text using requests, which is already a project dependency. No additional SDK required. For low-confidence results or when distinguishing `ai-assisted` cases, we fall back to GPT-4o for nuanced analysis.

**2. Virality: Content-Intrinsic Scoring**

- Virality scoring uses GPT-4o to reason across four content-intrinsic sub-signals, each scored 0–25 (summing to 100):

  - **emotional_trigger** (0–25) — does it provoke a strong reaction (awe, humor, outrage, relatability)?
  - **hook_quality** (0–25) — does the opening create immediate forward tension?
  - **novelty** (0–25) — is it surprising enough to share but familiar enough to understand instantly?
  - **compression** (0–25) — is a large or resonant idea expressed in a tight package?

**3. Distribution: LLM-Reasoned Audience Mapping**

- Distribution analysis uses GPT-4o to reason from content signals — including content type (short-form video, long-form article, tutorial, meme, etc.), topics, domain vocabulary, tone, register, cultural references, and humor style — and maps them to 1–3 most likely audience targets from a fixed taxonomy:

  - `Tech Twitter · LinkedIn · Reddit · TikTok · YouTube · Substack/Newsletters · Niche Discord/Community · Mainstream News`

**4. Explanation of Analysis**

- Each output includes a summary detailing how the results were determined, along with associated confidence scores for each analysis. This ensures transparency in reasoning and highlights areas where the agent's certainty is higher or lower.

## Considerations for further improvement

- Secure File Processing

  Handle malicious, oversized, or corrupted files with validation, sanitization, and size limits. Provide clear feedback to users when files are rejected or require preprocessing.

- Telemetry & Logging

  Add session-level telemetry and logging to track user interactions, API performance, and error patterns for continuous agent improvement and debugging.

- AI-Assisted Ratio Breakdown

  For `ai-assisted` content, provide a granular ratio score showing what percentage of different elements are AI-generated (e.g., 25% deepfake video, 20% synthetic background audio, 30% AI-edited text, 25% human-created content).

- Distribution-Driven Virality Calculation

  Calculate virality scores directly from distribution analysis by analyzing the size, engagement rates, and growth potential of identified target audiences.

- Confidence Calibration

  Add a second-pass "challenge" prompt where the model critiques its own output and surfaces low-confidence dimensions explicitly.

- GPTZero SDK Integration

  Replace raw HTTP calls to GPTZero with the official SDK for better error handling, retry logic, and access to the full response schema including sentence-level AI probability scores.
